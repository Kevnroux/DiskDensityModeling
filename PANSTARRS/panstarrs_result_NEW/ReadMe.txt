Tons of stuff going on. The csv files like GalacticNorthLattitute7.5.csv or Error_galactic_northLatitude.csv are generated
by the diskfitting program itself. Then, CalculateError.py is run it generates the calc_error_galacticnorthlat12.5 csv files.
 Finally the makescatter and makescatterError.py are run to generate the graphs.
